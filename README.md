# Introduction

This this is a toolbox for generating randomized, semi-realistic shapes that can be used for biomedical image augmentation.

It is suggested that you create and activate a new mamba environment with python 3.9. You can learn how to install mamba by following the instructions provided in the [Miniforge repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

```bash
mamba create -n synthshapes python=3.9
mamba activate synthshapes
```

Now let's install install SynthShapes from pypi! It's as easy as that!
