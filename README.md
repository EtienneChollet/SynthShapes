# SynthShapes

SynthShapes is a PyTorch toolbox for generating synthetic 3D shapes, tailored specifically for augmenting biomedical imaging datasets. It allows users to create complex, realistic shapes for use in machine learning pipelines, especially when training data is scarce or needs augmentation.

# Installation

It is suggested that you create and activate a new mamba environment with python 3.9. You can learn how to install mamba by following the instructions provided in the [Miniforge repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).

```bash
mamba create -n synthshapes python=3.9
mamba activate synthshapes
```

Now let's install install SynthShapes from pypi! It's as easy as that!

```bash
pip install SynthShapes
```
